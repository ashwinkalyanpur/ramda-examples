Functional Javascript Exmples using Ramda in Ember
Why not Underscore OR Lodash
Ramda  makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.
Last but not least, Ramda strives for performance. A reliable and quick implementation wins over any notions of functional purity.
Underscore and Lodash offers some functional concepts like map, filter and reduce. But they dont encourage functional style for composition, currying etc.
