# Functional Javascript Exmples using Ramda in Ember
##Why not Underscore OR Lodash
* Ramda  makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.
* Ramda strives for performance. A reliable and quick implementation wins over any notions of functional purity.
* Underscore and Lodash offers some functional concepts like map, filter and reduce. But they dont encourage functional style for composition, currying etc.
